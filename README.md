My initial and introductory repository
So, I come from an IT background. Mainly Desktop Administration with a sprinkle of networking, IT security, Service Deks support.
I've been considering some  type of coding for years now and finally decided to take the dive. 
I'm familiar with Java, Python, HTML,and CSS and looking to become prolific within the next year or so.
